00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,840
Let me ask you a question straight up the bat. Like are you a passport bro?

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,160
Wow, probably a proud passport boy. Okay. That's what's up, and you love like weird all the places you've been

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,940
Okay, so

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:37,720
Took a little down. So this will be Thailand. I'm gonna go backwards Thailand

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,360
Dominican Republic

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,200
Brazil

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Cartagena

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:57,560
Yes, I already said the Dominican Republic. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He said the makeup. Oh, I'll say the Dominican Republic twice right and

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,200
You love to travel like the traveling's in your blood now. Yes, you love to travel. I

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,040
Love it too, man. Look at this this beautiful landscape

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,320
Got Asian people everywhere

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,860
What do you think about

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,720
The places you've been like what would you say about some of the places you've been

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,040
Every place I've been to has his own shared experience

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,080
Um

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
some very

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,200
Every every place I'll say is at least pleasant. It's

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,760
It's pleasant

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,440
You have to adapt to each place that we have to adapt but

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:48,160
Overall the one thing I've known is seen about every place is the energy you give is energy you receive that's dope

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Very very dope, bro

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,560
Energy you receive is the energy you get back. So what you know, whatever you give is what you get back. That is very dope

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,760
Could you pick yourself living overseas? Definitely. That's when the time is right. Yeah, um

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,160
Everywhere I go. I'm looking at infrastructure. I'm looking at their their economic infrastructure. I'm looking at

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,240
Businesses grants. I'm looking at everything. Yeah, I'm looking at different the needs one thing

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,520
Like for instance here in Pattaya in Thailand motorbikes are like the main

32
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:32,360
One of the most main ways of transportation, right? That's true. So if I wanted to open a business here, I would like I would one of the things

33
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
I would think about is

34
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,040
Something that has to do with motorbikes right maintaining selling them

35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,120
That's true. It's one of the first thing that comes to mind. Airbnb's too. Airbnb's is very popular and shit Airbnb's

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,920
I'm open to a lot of different things, but it's definitely on the mind, right?

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,120
Now around your way in Philadelphia shout to Philadelphia my biggest market a lot of brothers

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Do you know you went to school with a high school with college with they travel?

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Not too many not too many

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,600
That's a crime too. Yeah. Yeah, I tried to

41
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,840
I'm always positive. I'm always I

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Don't want to come up braggadocious

43
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,720
But while also one thing I want to move you see I was a little close

44
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,560
I

45
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:25,960
Want to encourage without being braggadocious. So a lot of people have a mentality that traveling requires a lot of money

46
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,760
A lot of no, it doesn't a lot of stuff if you start small

47
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,360
And you budget and you plan and you just go it's a lot easier

48
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,240
And my community or my circles I'm always encouraging people to travel because hey, I came from the exact same place you did

49
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,440
I'm not special. I'm not a superhuman. I'm not rich if I can do it anybody

50
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,280
So you yeah, yeah, yeah, you struggle a little bit in your youth, right?

51
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
Well, you know big family

52
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,200
to household income, you know

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,920
You know back in the 90s. It wasn't as hard as it is now

54
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,480
But at the end of the day, we have the amount of siblings I had

55
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,800
You didn't have the Disney World trips every year. Thanks, but you know, we went to OSHA City, Maryland

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,000
So my parents is still traveling in me and us

57
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,760
You know ever since we were little and now I'm older. I can just go and do whatever I want

58
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,880
What do you think about people that look down on passport bro? Oh, I love I love love it

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,000
I love when people speak negative about passport bros because

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,040
It's rooted in ignorance

61
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
for instance

62
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,000
I've had this conversation with a couple women

63
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,160
They and I told them I'm a passport bro. She was like, are you proud of that like very proud

64
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,360
And I'll ask that I told her the main reason why

65
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,520
There's a negative

66
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,240
Stigmatism with passport bro with the term passport bro. It's because it involves black men

67
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,360
if there was a British man who went to America and

68
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,040
Engaged in different relationships with American women. No one would say anything about it

69
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,400
In fact, they call them James Bond and I'll make movies about them and I'll make money off of them

70
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,760
But for some reason if a black man wants to go to another country and

71
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,720
Indulge in other countries. It's a problem. Why is that a problem?

72
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Because then boy black man

73
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,720
That's deep you just went deep word up that that's that that's that's that's very very true

74
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,560
They don't say that to the white man. They don't say that to these motherfuckers. Look at that guy. I'm that guy

75
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,160
Don't say that to them. No disrespect to them. No

76
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,680
because if a guy from Mexico of a Mexican guy

77
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,320
went to Argentina

78
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,760
Found an Argentinian wife. No one would say a single thing. Word up

79
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,960
But for some reason if a black man wants to go to Costa Rica and find love there

80
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,600
Right, it's gonna ask yourself why is

81
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,120
So yes proud proud passport

82
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,840
Where would Thailand be on your list of top five places you would go?

83
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,440
Like as far as like you've been the Dominican Republic. You've been to Colombia. You've been to other places

84
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,200
So your top five places you'd like to go

85
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,520
What would you put Thailand as far as as far as the overall experience?

86
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
Thailand is

87
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,360
Third, I would say second third the culture the economics

88
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,320
The opportunities to do different adventurous things

89
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,080
Thailand is third. Okay when it comes to

90
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Excursions

91
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,000
Brazil second

92
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
Columbia one

93
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,560
Columbia one, okay, but Thailand answer your question Thailand is third now growing up

94
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,280
Did you we just meet you in chapter 215? We just discussed and walking down there and

95
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,840
Ten years ago, would you see yourself in fucking Thailand and

96
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:26,160
Body facts we working out bunch of ball motherfuckers tattoos. It's it's all about a mentality

97
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,000
if I'm the kind of person who I'm

98
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
outgoing and

99
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm willing to put myself out there. I'm secure enough for myself to be who I am

100
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
I

101
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:50,360
Love that I'm I am here and I'm anxious to see where the next few years take

102
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,760
Yeah

103
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,400
Good wealth and health and all that running around

104
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,280
Now, let me ask you a question because I know you pretty much forward and all that

105
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,440
Yeah, I love peace of the shit on your face. What?

106
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,080
It's Vidalaga Vidalaga Vidalaga, right?

107
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,040
Is that one of the reason I didn't want to get too serious with this? Come on. Yeah, I know I know okay

108
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,280
So let's start dancing to say the patio. There you go. Big man. There you go

109
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:26,320
My Vidalago happened I wasn't born with this talk a little loud. I wasn't born with this. Okay. I was 21

110
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,720
When it started off as a small little scratch it looked like a scratch

111
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,480
but

112
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:41,400
Understand every human body is different. Yeah, everybody's Vidalago is different Michael Jackson had all over his hands

113
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,840
He had all over my personal Vidalago story had to do a stress

114
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,600
I was very stressful when I was 21 and

115
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,040
The root cause for my stress I rooted it out and when I was 22 it stopped

116
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,320
So my Vidalago has just been it's just this

117
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,320
And once I cut out that stress I stopped stressing in my life really it stopped spreading

118
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,440
So that's as far as it's gonna go. God bless as far as I know

119
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,000
All right, so what Vidalago is is basically when your white blood cells attack your pigment cells

120
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
That's Vidalaga

121
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,960
There's no cream. There's no reason as to why as far as my knowledge goes

122
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,120
No one knows why your white blood cells just start attacking your pigment cells

123
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,040
The only thing doctors can say is it may be stress-related. It's not hereditary

124
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,520
Nobody in my family had it. It's not something I could pass on to my kid

125
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,720
Every human body is different. Everybody was trans responses stress different. Oh, yeah, some people gain weight

126
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Some people lose their mind

127
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,720
Modest my stress caused me to develop it a lot. That's how it is

128
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,240
Yeah, you're very honest and forthcoming dude, so I figure there ain't a problem

129
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:04,520
You feel like you do better with women outside the country as far as Columbia, Thailand

130
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Columbia and all that

131
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,520
My experience with women is pretty much the same everywhere

132
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Um

133
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,840
Because my approach to women is always the same. I don't

134
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,040
I'm currently not looking for a relationship at all. Hmm. So every

135
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
basis of me

136
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,960
interacting with a woman is on a

137
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Friendship. Hey, what's going on? Hey, you want to go out? No, okay? Bye. All right, whatever or hey, we got this in play

138
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,400
it's

139
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,520
it's

140
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,360
I'm not looking for anything. So because I don't have that I

141
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,840
Don't have to worry about that. Right. Everything is just how it is. Right. So I have the exact same success

142
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
here and

143
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
I spoke about the energy thing earlier

144
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,760
It doesn't matter what country I went to I

145
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,600
Have had a shared experience in every country which blows my mind

146
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:24,600
I've made connections with women that are deep and we don't even speak the same language and of course

147
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,260
the

148
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,860
The trope is oh, they only doing it for your money. No

149
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,720
No, this is this morning. Yeah, it's morning. When you're able to talk to someone every day

150
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,840
And money is never the conversation. We're talking about what do you like to do?

151
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,200
What's your family do like what you doing today? What's your job? What's your goals?

152
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,640
Like it's a connection. That's deeper than just a transaction

153
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,900
So and I've had that experience every country I've been to

154
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
It's kind of dope

155
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,560
So you really feel in the vibe like it's an energy thing with you it's like I think it's true

156
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,200
I think when you run into people there's a connection like this guy's cool and this guy's a jerk

157
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Yeah, you know I'm in like so definitely an energy thing like you know I'm saying like you're meeting good people good

158
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,800
Bob's the energy

159
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,280
You know I'm saying now imagine a question when you out here. Do you ever see yourself like living living here and working here?

160
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
Fucker. Well

161
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,480
I'm not in a state where I'm not in a position where I can just

162
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,680
Drop everything. I have a I have a child an older child teenager. Yeah

163
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,960
She's my number one priority, of course

164
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:57,880
After that a couple years, I have no idea, but that's why I'm traveling now, right so I can get an idea of

165
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,320
The possibilities that might be right

166
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,240
That might be presented to me later, right?

167
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,400
Do you feel like as a black man, do you feel a difference traveling as opposed to Gunther back there?

168
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Well

169
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,800
Being from America, it's hard to not notice the differences, but

170
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:27,520
As a black man as a black man, you already know there's certain things you want to encounter certain advantages of shit

171
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,840
I'm not just certain things you'll encounter, you know

172
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,720
but I

173
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:40,360
Try not to let negative things spoil or outweigh the positives because there's a lot of positive

174
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,000
As humans we focus on the negative that's just what we do

175
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,560
But I like to focus on a positive good interactions

176
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,800
You know the friendly interactions I have I like to focus on that one. Yeah, how are you with the people?

177
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,560
What do you think about we switch it up just a little bit little something on that? We think soy six. Hey like say six

178
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
Sys compared to Pedro Casante

179
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,080
What's Pedro Casante?

180
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,080
Pedro Casante is with Rumba and all that shit. He said where's Pedro Casante?

181
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,880
Two on five just pulled up. Mr. Workout sitting written there for five minutes and came back out

182
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
See what he had

183
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,280
Soy six was cool at first. I didn't think

184
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,560
I thought it'd be a little it was a little much, but nah, I dapped it. It's cool. I like it

185
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
Yeah, okay

186
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,000
If you can cuz you leaving basically tonight, yeah

187
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,400
But I deal like if you could just blink your eyes like a genie and all that how many more days would you stay? Oh?

188
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,560
I will say another week. Okay. Okay, cuz I will turn this trip because we're in Asia

189
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,680
I also want to go to the Philippines. I will turn this trip into another trip and go to the Philippines for like four days

190
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,540
Don't you think you could really call your job be like y'all twist my ankle at the shoreline? Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye

191
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:12,400
I'm not coming in. Nah, I don't mess with my money. I don't mess with my money. I'm budget everything

192
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,160
So it's right drama, right? Yeah CDL truck driver

193
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,640
I

194
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,880
I'm in I'm in the black. I like to stay in the black

195
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,440
I'm for seeing occurrences before everyone so I

196
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Don't wait for I

197
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,800
Don't wait for things to happen. Let's start grinding. I'd rather grind right force them happen so that I can be ready

198
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,920
I I you know what? I totally dig that cause fly different color

199
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,960
I know I dig a hundred percent where you're coming from man

200
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,040
Like, you know, every you know saying like I feel like it's gonna sound corny. I'm like you listen to

201
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,320
But like, you know, you're driving your job your responsibility obligation. I feel like me being out here

202
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,720
I'm like the test dummy for the niggas that haven't came yet. You know, like I was here two more times before this time

203
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,440
So I kind of feel like this is my job condo. I don't know

204
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
you're doing a great service because

205
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,240
one of the reasons one of the reasons why I felt super comfortable

206
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:17,400
Going this trip is because I already knew that we were gonna be with somebody who's been out here already. That's what's up

207
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:24,080
So knowing how to move is very important when you go places, right? For instance, um

208
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,560
Layover is in Qatar

209
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,320
You can't move the same way in Qatar

210
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,640
World that you do in America. I picked those sides to you will have a very rude awakening

211
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,360
Thinking that you can move that way in Qatar. You know what though? You ain't got no visors

212
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,160
I'm in the bad from sneaking my vape and shit. I'm like, you think it's for me under for like two years

213
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,360
Yeah, see, I don't I don't indulge in nothing. I'll drink a beer or two. That's dope, but uh

214
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,260
But that's for another reason. I'm afraid. I'm very afraid of drugs

215
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,780
Very afraid of what drugs because I have a very addictive

216
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,780
Personality like if I find something I like it's too hard to stop. So I'm too afraid just to try anything

217
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,100
Too afraid. So do you ever could see you ever see yourself?

218
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,060
With an entire woman like full-time part-time. I

219
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,620
Should on buddy

220
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:22,380
Um, actually remember that connection I was talking about earlier in Bangkok. I sort of had a nice connection with

221
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,580
Taya her name is Taya Taya, okay, Taya

222
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,980
Unfortunately, we weren't there long enough

223
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,300
but I feel like the energy she was giving I

224
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,700
Could have that could have turned into something. Okay, I had more time. So I won't say no

225
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:47,460
But I'm sure Taya isn't the only one I could have felt that way. So I'm not gonna say no

226
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,180
I'm not gonna say a hundred percent. I'll say it's possible. Now. Listen

227
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,620
There's a strong strong

228
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,380
Philadelphia community that traveling man, like the Philly get now nice. Okay, shorty

229
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:08,260
Go crowd. Just sitting you at the spot. That's the best spot. Okay. Oh, yeah Philly runs a lot of brothers from Philadelphia, bro

230
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:15,900
Good. Yeah, and it was crazy. Philadelphia's only 30 minutes big. That's crazy. Yeah, like that's crazy to me

231
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,220
I encourage everyone to travel

232
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,500
Everyone well, even if you can only travel one time per year, right? Just do it

233
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,500
Even if you're for five a five-day trip, let's say

234
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,700
because

235
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,060
okay

236
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,780
From Philadelphia

237
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,780
You can leave from the Philadelphia airport

238
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,700
We're connecting flights from Miami to the DR or you can catch the train and Amtrak

239
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,740
Catch that up to New York. Do a straight flight to the DR

240
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:52,900
From JFK, it's so simple. It's so cheap. It's so simple that one trip will inspire you

241
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,820
to

242
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,540
Take another one. Yeah, the next you know, you're doing two a year

243
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:04,420
You know, you know, you're doing three next. You know, you're doing four a year and now you're like, whoa every three months

244
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,420
I just realized I'm somewhere else

245
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:13,540
And that's how you grow as a person, right? It's impossible to take these trips and not have human interactions

246
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,740
That's not gonna impact. It's impossible. Right impossible

247
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,420
So that's the beauty of it

248
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,060
That's dope, man. I mean

249
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,580
Like I said, I was scared to death before I traveled to the Dominican Republic. So, you know, I tell people just take a chance

250
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,620
Let me tell you something

251
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,980
Do not listen to people

252
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:47,300
Experience things on your own. I've never been to Thailand. I have had hundreds of people tell me there's nothing but ladyboys everywhere

253
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,060
Oh, be careful. They're gonna run into it

254
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:56,660
They never stepped outside of Philly the same people saying this word people who never stepped outside of Philly. I get here

255
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,700
It's beautiful. I think I've ran into like four ladyboys my whole trip here

256
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,740
for

257
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,860
Even when I did I was in a pharmacy and one of them was helping me with my skin care

258
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:16,780
Like I'm very secure in my sexuality. So it's like I'm not I'm not like afraid of

259
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,300
Afraid to talk to him or anything. I know that's not that's not what I do

260
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,660
So it's like it's not gonna be afraid of

261
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,220
Like I feel like if people want to live the life they want to live they live my life

262
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,100
Live yours, it's not to be afraid of so overall getting back to the main point

263
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:41,820
Everybody's gonna have something to say. Oh, you go to the DR is nothing but STDs and everything or it's violence in

264
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,620
No, go experience it for your side once you do that

265
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,460
You'll see do you see yourself coming back to Thailand anytime soon

266
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,500
Probably next year

267
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:02,060
Probably next year I have some other trips longer. It's gonna be longer next time. Well, it'll be it'll be a duo

268
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,060
I'm gonna split it

269
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:09,260
Because I really want to go to the Philippines and you I heard you I think to to set it that you want to go to Phuket

270
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:16,140
Yeah, I want to go to Phuket because I like the island man. Yeah, I like the islands. I love the water

271
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,100
I

272
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,100
Love the prices of everything here

273
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,340
Like yacht excursions for hundred and eight dollars

274
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,220
You're not much of a yacht will run you in Miami

275
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,220
A lot of times I didn't want to get too deep into it, but you're a religious man

276
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,860
Higher belief in God and all that that's what keeps us healthy and safe and all of that like I

277
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,300
Think it's important that you know, you know, you're religious and all that like you still

278
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,740
Travel right like you still playing on traveling. Look it down act like you don't know

279
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,020
I know you didn't want to get I didn't want to get too deep into it to put you on the spot

280
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:07,260
But you know you're a religious man. Yes, I do believe in a creator flesh is weak. I do believe in the creator

281
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,620
Yeah, I will contain a travel okay, we believe that that is uncomfortable just like talking about the Eagles

282
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,620
It's very uncomfortable. No, I'm not really eaters

283
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:23,340
No, you the same attitude you just took the same attitude you said I talk about the Eagles cheaters

284
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
cheaters I

285
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:32,820
Brought my Zikwan Barclay Jersey here. I got love. I got love right people that me up all over down here

286
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,260
That's cuz everybody know

287
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,700
World champs. What do you want to say to somebody that's scared to travel that hasn't traveled?

288
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,500
I think you already covered it, but what would be a message to be like?

289
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,820
Say like somebody that'd be like you met me at work. He's training and then you'd be like, uh-uh, I get killed

290
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:54,580
Can I people say that about the or still I'll get killed if I go out there and they still say that I get killed if I go out there

291
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:00,140
All right, so I would say reach out to some different people in the travel you

292
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:07,220
Youtubers. Yes reach out because the one thing about the travel community is we encourage we want more

293
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,340
We want more members of the travel community. Thanks, and I can't speak for

294
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,700
Every single person, but I would say at least eight out of ten will direct you in a way

295
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,820
That will benefit you like we're not out here to fool you to steal your money

296
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,340
We want you to have a successful

297
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,660
Excessful encounter when you do travel reach out

298
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,540
Talk to different people ask them. Yeah, right down questions. Ask them exactly what you do

299
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:41,460
Is it safe? How do you how do I take out money? Where can I use my card here? Like just ask

300
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,220
Just ask

301
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:51,620
Yeah, cuz once you actually do it, you'll see you're like, oh, I was afraid of a lot of things that were unnecessary

302
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,180
What was the scariest part about taking this flight even though you was going with my man over there?

303
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
She's well, I'm

304
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,340
320 pounds so the thing I was most afraid of was sitting there see

305
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,980
like so I

306
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,380
Was able to get in the seat and I was I was cool, but that was scary. I didn't know that

307
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,340
That's a proper thing to pay, but you got to realize that people travel too

308
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,140
We know they turn us into cargo planes and shit

309
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,860
There's no seats just let us roll around at the planes moving and shit, but also that's a form of inspiration also

310
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,380
For myself personally don't go too deep. I'm not you only got a certain amount of time

311
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Because we look around his dog they close

312
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,980
All the stuff at the base like

313
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,980
No
