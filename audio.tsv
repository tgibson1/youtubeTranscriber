63760	67040	Love it too, man. Look at this this beautiful landscape
68320	70320	Got Asian people everywhere
71360	73860	What do you think about
75640	78720	The places you've been like what would you say about some of the places you've been
80640	84040	Every place I've been to has his own shared experience
84960	86080	Um
86080	88080	some very
88600	91200	Every every place I'll say is at least pleasant. It's
92760	94760	It's pleasant
95520	100440	You have to adapt to each place that we have to adapt but
101240	108160	Overall the one thing I've known is seen about every place is the energy you give is energy you receive that's dope
109040	111040	Very very dope, bro
111120	116560	Energy you receive is the energy you get back. So what you know, whatever you give is what you get back. That is very dope
117040	122760	Could you pick yourself living overseas? Definitely. That's when the time is right. Yeah, um
123840	130160	Everywhere I go. I'm looking at infrastructure. I'm looking at their their economic infrastructure. I'm looking at
130960	137240	Businesses grants. I'm looking at everything. Yeah, I'm looking at different the needs one thing
138240	143520	Like for instance here in Pattaya in Thailand motorbikes are like the main
144960	152360	One of the most main ways of transportation, right? That's true. So if I wanted to open a business here, I would like I would one of the things
152360	154360	I would think about is
154960	158040	Something that has to do with motorbikes right maintaining selling them
158720	164120	That's true. It's one of the first thing that comes to mind. Airbnb's too. Airbnb's is very popular and shit Airbnb's
164400	167920	I'm open to a lot of different things, but it's definitely on the mind, right?
170160	175120	Now around your way in Philadelphia shout to Philadelphia my biggest market a lot of brothers
175120	178120	Do you know you went to school with a high school with college with they travel?
179600	181600	Not too many not too many
182720	185600	That's a crime too. Yeah. Yeah, I tried to
186320	188840	I'm always positive. I'm always I
189440	191440	Don't want to come up braggadocious
191560	194720	But while also one thing I want to move you see I was a little close
195720	197560	I
197560	205960	Want to encourage without being braggadocious. So a lot of people have a mentality that traveling requires a lot of money
205960	209760	A lot of no, it doesn't a lot of stuff if you start small
210520	215360	And you budget and you plan and you just go it's a lot easier
216120	222240	And my community or my circles I'm always encouraging people to travel because hey, I came from the exact same place you did
222760	227440	I'm not special. I'm not a superhuman. I'm not rich if I can do it anybody
227440	230280	So you yeah, yeah, yeah, you struggle a little bit in your youth, right?
231520	233520	Well, you know big family
233840	236200	to household income, you know
237640	240920	You know back in the 90s. It wasn't as hard as it is now
241520	245480	But at the end of the day, we have the amount of siblings I had
246280	251800	You didn't have the Disney World trips every year. Thanks, but you know, we went to OSHA City, Maryland
252080	256000	So my parents is still traveling in me and us
256640	262760	You know ever since we were little and now I'm older. I can just go and do whatever I want
264560	270880	What do you think about people that look down on passport bro? Oh, I love I love love it
271200	275000	I love when people speak negative about passport bros because
276040	278040	It's rooted in ignorance
279040	281040	for instance
281040	284000	I've had this conversation with a couple women
284760	289160	They and I told them I'm a passport bro. She was like, are you proud of that like very proud
289520	292360	And I'll ask that I told her the main reason why
292920	294520	There's a negative
294520	300240	Stigmatism with passport bro with the term passport bro. It's because it involves black men
300920	304360	if there was a British man who went to America and
305360	310040	Engaged in different relationships with American women. No one would say anything about it
310040	315400	In fact, they call them James Bond and I'll make movies about them and I'll make money off of them
315440	319760	But for some reason if a black man wants to go to another country and
320360	324720	Indulge in other countries. It's a problem. Why is that a problem?
325360	327360	Because then boy black man
327360	333720	That's deep you just went deep word up that that's that that's that's that's very very true
333840	338560	They don't say that to the white man. They don't say that to these motherfuckers. Look at that guy. I'm that guy
339160	342160	Don't say that to them. No disrespect to them. No
342600	346680	because if a guy from Mexico of a Mexican guy
347320	349320	went to Argentina
349320	353760	Found an Argentinian wife. No one would say a single thing. Word up
354120	359960	But for some reason if a black man wants to go to Costa Rica and find love there
361400	364600	Right, it's gonna ask yourself why is
365560	369120	So yes proud proud passport
370720	374840	Where would Thailand be on your list of top five places you would go?
376360	381440	Like as far as like you've been the Dominican Republic. You've been to Colombia. You've been to other places
381720	384200	So your top five places you'd like to go
385600	391520	What would you put Thailand as far as as far as the overall experience?
392720	394720	Thailand is
394720	400360	Third, I would say second third the culture the economics
401640	405320	The opportunities to do different adventurous things
406240	409080	Thailand is third. Okay when it comes to
410080	412080	Excursions
416600	419000	Brazil second
420720	422720	Columbia one
422920	428560	Columbia one, okay, but Thailand answer your question Thailand is third now growing up
429760	434280	Did you we just meet you in chapter 215? We just discussed and walking down there and
434800	437840	Ten years ago, would you see yourself in fucking Thailand and
439320	446160	Body facts we working out bunch of ball motherfuckers tattoos. It's it's all about a mentality
446920	450000	if I'm the kind of person who I'm
451080	453080	outgoing and
454400	459760	I'm willing to put myself out there. I'm secure enough for myself to be who I am
460760	462760	I
463280	470360	Love that I'm I am here and I'm anxious to see where the next few years take
471760	473760	Yeah
473880	476400	Good wealth and health and all that running around
477040	480280	Now, let me ask you a question because I know you pretty much forward and all that
480280	483440	Yeah, I love peace of the shit on your face. What?
484320	487080	It's Vidalaga Vidalaga Vidalaga, right?
487880	493040	Is that one of the reason I didn't want to get too serious with this? Come on. Yeah, I know I know okay
493040	496280	So let's start dancing to say the patio. There you go. Big man. There you go
498480	506320	My Vidalago happened I wasn't born with this talk a little loud. I wasn't born with this. Okay. I was 21
507440	511720	When it started off as a small little scratch it looked like a scratch
512600	514480	but
514480	521400	Understand every human body is different. Yeah, everybody's Vidalago is different Michael Jackson had all over his hands
521400	525840	He had all over my personal Vidalago story had to do a stress
525840	528600	I was very stressful when I was 21 and
529840	536040	The root cause for my stress I rooted it out and when I was 22 it stopped
536400	539320	So my Vidalago has just been it's just this
540320	545320	And once I cut out that stress I stopped stressing in my life really it stopped spreading
545320	548440	So that's as far as it's gonna go. God bless as far as I know
548720	555000	All right, so what Vidalago is is basically when your white blood cells attack your pigment cells
555400	557400	That's Vidalaga
557600	562960	There's no cream. There's no reason as to why as far as my knowledge goes
563200	568120	No one knows why your white blood cells just start attacking your pigment cells
568480	573040	The only thing doctors can say is it may be stress-related. It's not hereditary
573800	577520	Nobody in my family had it. It's not something I could pass on to my kid
578600	584720	Every human body is different. Everybody was trans responses stress different. Oh, yeah, some people gain weight
585000	587000	Some people lose their mind
587400	591720	Modest my stress caused me to develop it a lot. That's how it is
592320	596240	Yeah, you're very honest and forthcoming dude, so I figure there ain't a problem
597520	604520	You feel like you do better with women outside the country as far as Columbia, Thailand
607000	609000	Columbia and all that
611720	615520	My experience with women is pretty much the same everywhere
615520	617520	Um
617800	621840	Because my approach to women is always the same. I don't
623280	629040	I'm currently not looking for a relationship at all. Hmm. So every
630040	632040	basis of me
632080	634960	interacting with a woman is on a
635480	642480	Friendship. Hey, what's going on? Hey, you want to go out? No, okay? Bye. All right, whatever or hey, we got this in play
642480	643400	it's
643400	644520	it's
644520	648360	I'm not looking for anything. So because I don't have that I
648920	654840	Don't have to worry about that. Right. Everything is just how it is. Right. So I have the exact same success
655520	657520	here and
658280	660280	I spoke about the energy thing earlier
661120	663760	It doesn't matter what country I went to I
664200	670600	Have had a shared experience in every country which blows my mind
675520	684600	I've made connections with women that are deep and we don't even speak the same language and of course
685760	687260	the
687260	690860	The trope is oh, they only doing it for your money. No
691520	697720	No, this is this morning. Yeah, it's morning. When you're able to talk to someone every day
698240	702840	And money is never the conversation. We're talking about what do you like to do?
702840	706200	What's your family do like what you doing today? What's your job? What's your goals?
706200	710640	Like it's a connection. That's deeper than just a transaction
711280	714900	So and I've had that experience every country I've been to
717240	719240	It's kind of dope
721400	726560	So you really feel in the vibe like it's an energy thing with you it's like I think it's true
726560	731200	I think when you run into people there's a connection like this guy's cool and this guy's a jerk
731200	737200	Yeah, you know I'm in like so definitely an energy thing like you know I'm saying like you're meeting good people good
737200	738800	Bob's the energy
738800	746280	You know I'm saying now imagine a question when you out here. Do you ever see yourself like living living here and working here?
746920	748920	Fucker. Well
751600	756480	I'm not in a state where I'm not in a position where I can just
757360	762680	Drop everything. I have a I have a child an older child teenager. Yeah
766680	768960	She's my number one priority, of course
771080	777880	After that a couple years, I have no idea, but that's why I'm traveling now, right so I can get an idea of
779080	781320	The possibilities that might be right
782040	784240	That might be presented to me later, right?
785160	790400	Do you feel like as a black man, do you feel a difference traveling as opposed to Gunther back there?
791960	793960	Well
794320	799800	Being from America, it's hard to not notice the differences, but
800760	807520	As a black man as a black man, you already know there's certain things you want to encounter certain advantages of shit
807520	809840	I'm not just certain things you'll encounter, you know
811200	812720	but I
812740	820360	Try not to let negative things spoil or outweigh the positives because there's a lot of positive
822040	825000	As humans we focus on the negative that's just what we do
825480	828560	But I like to focus on a positive good interactions
829200	834800	You know the friendly interactions I have I like to focus on that one. Yeah, how are you with the people?
835440	841560	What do you think about we switch it up just a little bit little something on that? We think soy six. Hey like say six
842960	844960	Sys compared to Pedro Casante
845240	847080	What's Pedro Casante?
847080	850080	Pedro Casante is with Rumba and all that shit. He said where's Pedro Casante?
850800	855880	Two on five just pulled up. Mr. Workout sitting written there for five minutes and came back out
860000	862000	See what he had
862000	864280	Soy six was cool at first. I didn't think
865440	870560	I thought it'd be a little it was a little much, but nah, I dapped it. It's cool. I like it
870560	872560	Yeah, okay
873760	877000	If you can cuz you leaving basically tonight, yeah
877120	882400	But I deal like if you could just blink your eyes like a genie and all that how many more days would you stay? Oh?
884400	890560	I will say another week. Okay. Okay, cuz I will turn this trip because we're in Asia
890560	897680	I also want to go to the Philippines. I will turn this trip into another trip and go to the Philippines for like four days
898360	904540	Don't you think you could really call your job be like y'all twist my ankle at the shoreline? Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye
906200	912400	I'm not coming in. Nah, I don't mess with my money. I don't mess with my money. I'm budget everything
913000	916160	So it's right drama, right? Yeah CDL truck driver
918160	919640	I
919640	922880	I'm in I'm in the black. I like to stay in the black
923520	926440	I'm for seeing occurrences before everyone so I
927160	929160	Don't wait for I
930200	935800	Don't wait for things to happen. Let's start grinding. I'd rather grind right force them happen so that I can be ready
935800	939920	I I you know what? I totally dig that cause fly different color
939920	943960	I know I dig a hundred percent where you're coming from man
944200	949040	Like, you know, every you know saying like I feel like it's gonna sound corny. I'm like you listen to
949840	955320	But like, you know, you're driving your job your responsibility obligation. I feel like me being out here
955320	960720	I'm like the test dummy for the niggas that haven't came yet. You know, like I was here two more times before this time
961080	964440	So I kind of feel like this is my job condo. I don't know
965000	967000	you're doing a great service because
967760	971240	one of the reasons one of the reasons why I felt super comfortable
971960	977400	Going this trip is because I already knew that we were gonna be with somebody who's been out here already. That's what's up
977400	984080	So knowing how to move is very important when you go places, right? For instance, um
985560	987560	Layover is in Qatar
987600	990320	You can't move the same way in Qatar
990600	995640	World that you do in America. I picked those sides to you will have a very rude awakening
996440	1000360	Thinking that you can move that way in Qatar. You know what though? You ain't got no visors
1000360	1005160	I'm in the bad from sneaking my vape and shit. I'm like, you think it's for me under for like two years
1005160	1010360	Yeah, see, I don't I don't indulge in nothing. I'll drink a beer or two. That's dope, but uh
1011040	1014260	But that's for another reason. I'm afraid. I'm very afraid of drugs
1014660	1018780	Very afraid of what drugs because I have a very addictive
1019420	1024780	Personality like if I find something I like it's too hard to stop. So I'm too afraid just to try anything
1025220	1029100	Too afraid. So do you ever could see you ever see yourself?
1029940	1033060	With an entire woman like full-time part-time. I
1034180	1035620	Should on buddy
1035620	1042380	Um, actually remember that connection I was talking about earlier in Bangkok. I sort of had a nice connection with
1043260	1046580	Taya her name is Taya Taya, okay, Taya
1048980	1050980	Unfortunately, we weren't there long enough
1051140	1055300	but I feel like the energy she was giving I
1056420	1061700	Could have that could have turned into something. Okay, I had more time. So I won't say no
1062420	1067460	But I'm sure Taya isn't the only one I could have felt that way. So I'm not gonna say no
1067460	1071180	I'm not gonna say a hundred percent. I'll say it's possible. Now. Listen
1071620	1073620	There's a strong strong
1075380	1080380	Philadelphia community that traveling man, like the Philly get now nice. Okay, shorty
1080900	1088260	Go crowd. Just sitting you at the spot. That's the best spot. Okay. Oh, yeah Philly runs a lot of brothers from Philadelphia, bro
1089300	1095900	Good. Yeah, and it was crazy. Philadelphia's only 30 minutes big. That's crazy. Yeah, like that's crazy to me
1095900	1098220	I encourage everyone to travel
1099140	1104500	Everyone well, even if you can only travel one time per year, right? Just do it
1105420	1108500	Even if you're for five a five-day trip, let's say
1109220	1110700	because
1110700	1112060	okay
1112060	1113780	From Philadelphia
1113780	1115780	You can leave from the Philadelphia airport
1115900	1121700	We're connecting flights from Miami to the DR or you can catch the train and Amtrak
1122020	1124740	Catch that up to New York. Do a straight flight to the DR
1125380	1132900	From JFK, it's so simple. It's so cheap. It's so simple that one trip will inspire you
1133860	1134820	to
1134820	1138540	Take another one. Yeah, the next you know, you're doing two a year
1138540	1144420	You know, you know, you're doing three next. You know, you're doing four a year and now you're like, whoa every three months
1144420	1146420	I just realized I'm somewhere else
1147180	1153540	And that's how you grow as a person, right? It's impossible to take these trips and not have human interactions
1153540	1156740	That's not gonna impact. It's impossible. Right impossible
1157420	1159420	So that's the beauty of it
1160060	1162060	That's dope, man. I mean
1162580	1167580	Like I said, I was scared to death before I traveled to the Dominican Republic. So, you know, I tell people just take a chance
1168620	1170620	Let me tell you something
1173460	1177980	Do not listen to people
1178740	1187300	Experience things on your own. I've never been to Thailand. I have had hundreds of people tell me there's nothing but ladyboys everywhere
1187300	1190060	Oh, be careful. They're gonna run into it
1190540	1196660	They never stepped outside of Philly the same people saying this word people who never stepped outside of Philly. I get here
1196820	1201700	It's beautiful. I think I've ran into like four ladyboys my whole trip here
1202260	1203740	for
1204180	1209860	Even when I did I was in a pharmacy and one of them was helping me with my skin care
1210380	1216780	Like I'm very secure in my sexuality. So it's like I'm not I'm not like afraid of
1217180	1221300	Afraid to talk to him or anything. I know that's not that's not what I do
1221660	1223660	So it's like it's not gonna be afraid of
1224060	1229220	Like I feel like if people want to live the life they want to live they live my life
1229660	1234100	Live yours, it's not to be afraid of so overall getting back to the main point
1234940	1241820	Everybody's gonna have something to say. Oh, you go to the DR is nothing but STDs and everything or it's violence in
1242380	1245620	No, go experience it for your side once you do that
1246740	1250460	You'll see do you see yourself coming back to Thailand anytime soon
1254660	1256500	Probably next year
1256500	1262060	Probably next year I have some other trips longer. It's gonna be longer next time. Well, it'll be it'll be a duo
1262220	1264060	I'm gonna split it
1264060	1269260	Because I really want to go to the Philippines and you I heard you I think to to set it that you want to go to Phuket
1269460	1276140	Yeah, I want to go to Phuket because I like the island man. Yeah, I like the islands. I love the water
1277340	1279100	I
1279100	1281100	Love the prices of everything here
1281940	1284340	Like yacht excursions for hundred and eight dollars
1285220	1287220	You're not much of a yacht will run you in Miami
1297100	1300220	A lot of times I didn't want to get too deep into it, but you're a religious man
1301220	1306860	Higher belief in God and all that that's what keeps us healthy and safe and all of that like I
1307700	1312300	Think it's important that you know, you know, you're religious and all that like you still
1313100	1316740	Travel right like you still playing on traveling. Look it down act like you don't know
1316740	1320020	I know you didn't want to get I didn't want to get too deep into it to put you on the spot
1320340	1327260	But you know you're a religious man. Yes, I do believe in a creator flesh is weak. I do believe in the creator
1330420	1335620	Yeah, I will contain a travel okay, we believe that that is uncomfortable just like talking about the Eagles
1335620	1337620	It's very uncomfortable. No, I'm not really eaters
1337620	1343340	No, you the same attitude you just took the same attitude you said I talk about the Eagles cheaters
1344100	1346100	cheaters I
1346660	1352820	Brought my Zikwan Barclay Jersey here. I got love. I got love right people that me up all over down here
1353260	1355260	That's cuz everybody know
1355340	1359700	World champs. What do you want to say to somebody that's scared to travel that hasn't traveled?
1359700	1362500	I think you already covered it, but what would be a message to be like?
1363220	1368820	Say like somebody that'd be like you met me at work. He's training and then you'd be like, uh-uh, I get killed
1368820	1374580	Can I people say that about the or still I'll get killed if I go out there and they still say that I get killed if I go out there
1374820	1380140	All right, so I would say reach out to some different people in the travel you
1380580	1387220	Youtubers. Yes reach out because the one thing about the travel community is we encourage we want more
1387460	1392340	We want more members of the travel community. Thanks, and I can't speak for
1392500	1397700	Every single person, but I would say at least eight out of ten will direct you in a way
1398340	1402820	That will benefit you like we're not out here to fool you to steal your money
1403340	1405340	We want you to have a successful
1406780	1409660	Excessful encounter when you do travel reach out
1410580	1415540	Talk to different people ask them. Yeah, right down questions. Ask them exactly what you do
1415540	1421460	Is it safe? How do you how do I take out money? Where can I use my card here? Like just ask
1423460	1425220	Just ask
1425220	1431620	Yeah, cuz once you actually do it, you'll see you're like, oh, I was afraid of a lot of things that were unnecessary
1431820	1436180	What was the scariest part about taking this flight even though you was going with my man over there?
1436900	1438900	She's well, I'm
1439540	1442340	320 pounds so the thing I was most afraid of was sitting there see
1442980	1444980	like so I
1445900	1450380	Was able to get in the seat and I was I was cool, but that was scary. I didn't know that
1450940	1454340	That's a proper thing to pay, but you got to realize that people travel too
1455220	1458140	We know they turn us into cargo planes and shit
1458140	1463860	There's no seats just let us roll around at the planes moving and shit, but also that's a form of inspiration also
1465300	1469380	For myself personally don't go too deep. I'm not you only got a certain amount of time
1470500	1472500	Because we look around his dog they close
1474980	1476980	All the stuff at the base like
1476980	1478980	No
1479860	1487220	Close it out close it out bring this home land the plane so not traveling you want it it forces you
1487940	1489940	to want to do more
1489940	1490900	fact and
1490900	1498260	Better job proceed. No, no job. I'm talking about health wise. Okay, and there are some things that you're
1499100	1504660	Your weight may prohibit you from doing paracels. I wanted to paracels. They was like, hey, you're too heavy
1507340	1514340	Okay, Brandon. Well, Brandon, if you want a paracel get that weight down you want to skydive get that weight down facts
1514340	1518900	So now I have in my mind. All right. They might have did you explain the patient? Yeah
1520500	1525940	No, it's not to be a it's not to be angry about or angry at somebody else. It's self-motivation
1526580	1533020	That's all okay because the next time I take a pic with me paracel and I'm gonna reference back this video
1533340	1537020	From when I was too happy to do it. Well, you don't watch my channel anyway, brother
