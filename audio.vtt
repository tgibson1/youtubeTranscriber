00:22.680 --> 00:29.160
Wow, probably a proud passport boy. Okay. That's what's up, and you love like weird all the places you've been

00:30.440 --> 00:31.940
Okay, so

00:31.940 --> 00:37.720
Took a little down. So this will be Thailand. I'm gonna go backwards Thailand

00:38.680 --> 00:40.360
Dominican Republic

00:40.360 --> 00:42.200
Brazil

00:42.200 --> 00:44.200
Cartagena

00:49.880 --> 00:57.560
Yes, I already said the Dominican Republic. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He said the makeup. Oh, I'll say the Dominican Republic twice right and

00:58.080 --> 01:03.200
You love to travel like the traveling's in your blood now. Yes, you love to travel. I

01:03.760 --> 01:07.040
Love it too, man. Look at this this beautiful landscape

01:08.320 --> 01:10.320
Got Asian people everywhere

01:11.360 --> 01:13.860
What do you think about

01:15.640 --> 01:18.720
The places you've been like what would you say about some of the places you've been

01:20.640 --> 01:24.040
Every place I've been to has his own shared experience

01:24.960 --> 01:26.080
Um

01:26.080 --> 01:28.080
some very

01:28.600 --> 01:31.200
Every every place I'll say is at least pleasant. It's

01:32.760 --> 01:34.760
It's pleasant

01:35.520 --> 01:40.440
You have to adapt to each place that we have to adapt but

01:41.240 --> 01:48.160
Overall the one thing I've known is seen about every place is the energy you give is energy you receive that's dope

01:49.040 --> 01:51.040
Very very dope, bro

01:51.120 --> 01:56.560
Energy you receive is the energy you get back. So what you know, whatever you give is what you get back. That is very dope

01:57.040 --> 02:02.760
Could you pick yourself living overseas? Definitely. That's when the time is right. Yeah, um

02:03.840 --> 02:10.160
Everywhere I go. I'm looking at infrastructure. I'm looking at their their economic infrastructure. I'm looking at

02:10.960 --> 02:17.240
Businesses grants. I'm looking at everything. Yeah, I'm looking at different the needs one thing

02:18.240 --> 02:23.520
Like for instance here in Pattaya in Thailand motorbikes are like the main

02:24.960 --> 02:32.360
One of the most main ways of transportation, right? That's true. So if I wanted to open a business here, I would like I would one of the things

02:32.360 --> 02:34.360
I would think about is

02:34.960 --> 02:38.040
Something that has to do with motorbikes right maintaining selling them

02:38.720 --> 02:44.120
That's true. It's one of the first thing that comes to mind. Airbnb's too. Airbnb's is very popular and shit Airbnb's

02:44.400 --> 02:47.920
I'm open to a lot of different things, but it's definitely on the mind, right?

02:50.160 --> 02:55.120
Now around your way in Philadelphia shout to Philadelphia my biggest market a lot of brothers

02:55.120 --> 02:58.120
Do you know you went to school with a high school with college with they travel?

02:59.600 --> 03:01.600
Not too many not too many

03:02.720 --> 03:05.600
That's a crime too. Yeah. Yeah, I tried to

03:06.320 --> 03:08.840
I'm always positive. I'm always I

03:09.440 --> 03:11.440
Don't want to come up braggadocious

03:11.560 --> 03:14.720
But while also one thing I want to move you see I was a little close

03:15.720 --> 03:17.560
I

03:17.560 --> 03:25.960
Want to encourage without being braggadocious. So a lot of people have a mentality that traveling requires a lot of money

03:25.960 --> 03:29.760
A lot of no, it doesn't a lot of stuff if you start small

03:30.520 --> 03:35.360
And you budget and you plan and you just go it's a lot easier

03:36.120 --> 03:42.240
And my community or my circles I'm always encouraging people to travel because hey, I came from the exact same place you did

03:42.760 --> 03:47.440
I'm not special. I'm not a superhuman. I'm not rich if I can do it anybody

03:47.440 --> 03:50.280
So you yeah, yeah, yeah, you struggle a little bit in your youth, right?

03:51.520 --> 03:53.520
Well, you know big family

03:53.840 --> 03:56.200
to household income, you know

03:57.640 --> 04:00.920
You know back in the 90s. It wasn't as hard as it is now

04:01.520 --> 04:05.480
But at the end of the day, we have the amount of siblings I had

04:06.280 --> 04:11.800
You didn't have the Disney World trips every year. Thanks, but you know, we went to OSHA City, Maryland

04:12.080 --> 04:16.000
So my parents is still traveling in me and us

04:16.640 --> 04:22.760
You know ever since we were little and now I'm older. I can just go and do whatever I want

04:24.560 --> 04:30.880
What do you think about people that look down on passport bro? Oh, I love I love love it

04:31.200 --> 04:35.000
I love when people speak negative about passport bros because

04:36.040 --> 04:38.040
It's rooted in ignorance

04:39.040 --> 04:41.040
for instance

04:41.040 --> 04:44.000
I've had this conversation with a couple women

04:44.760 --> 04:49.160
They and I told them I'm a passport bro. She was like, are you proud of that like very proud

04:49.520 --> 04:52.360
And I'll ask that I told her the main reason why

04:52.920 --> 04:54.520
There's a negative

04:54.520 --> 05:00.240
Stigmatism with passport bro with the term passport bro. It's because it involves black men

05:00.920 --> 05:04.360
if there was a British man who went to America and

05:05.360 --> 05:10.040
Engaged in different relationships with American women. No one would say anything about it

05:10.040 --> 05:15.400
In fact, they call them James Bond and I'll make movies about them and I'll make money off of them

05:15.440 --> 05:19.760
But for some reason if a black man wants to go to another country and

05:20.360 --> 05:24.720
Indulge in other countries. It's a problem. Why is that a problem?

05:25.360 --> 05:27.360
Because then boy black man

05:27.360 --> 05:33.720
That's deep you just went deep word up that that's that that's that's that's very very true

05:33.840 --> 05:38.560
They don't say that to the white man. They don't say that to these motherfuckers. Look at that guy. I'm that guy

05:39.160 --> 05:42.160
Don't say that to them. No disrespect to them. No

05:42.600 --> 05:46.680
because if a guy from Mexico of a Mexican guy

05:47.320 --> 05:49.320
went to Argentina

05:49.320 --> 05:53.760
Found an Argentinian wife. No one would say a single thing. Word up

05:54.120 --> 05:59.960
But for some reason if a black man wants to go to Costa Rica and find love there

06:01.400 --> 06:04.600
Right, it's gonna ask yourself why is

06:05.560 --> 06:09.120
So yes proud proud passport

06:10.720 --> 06:14.840
Where would Thailand be on your list of top five places you would go?

06:16.360 --> 06:21.440
Like as far as like you've been the Dominican Republic. You've been to Colombia. You've been to other places

06:21.720 --> 06:24.200
So your top five places you'd like to go

06:25.600 --> 06:31.520
What would you put Thailand as far as as far as the overall experience?

06:32.720 --> 06:34.720
Thailand is

06:34.720 --> 06:40.360
Third, I would say second third the culture the economics

06:41.640 --> 06:45.320
The opportunities to do different adventurous things

06:46.240 --> 06:49.080
Thailand is third. Okay when it comes to

06:50.080 --> 06:52.080
Excursions

06:56.600 --> 06:59.000
Brazil second

07:00.720 --> 07:02.720
Columbia one

07:02.920 --> 07:08.560
Columbia one, okay, but Thailand answer your question Thailand is third now growing up

07:09.760 --> 07:14.280
Did you we just meet you in chapter 215? We just discussed and walking down there and

07:14.800 --> 07:17.840
Ten years ago, would you see yourself in fucking Thailand and

07:19.320 --> 07:26.160
Body facts we working out bunch of ball motherfuckers tattoos. It's it's all about a mentality

07:26.920 --> 07:30.000
if I'm the kind of person who I'm

07:31.080 --> 07:33.080
outgoing and

07:34.400 --> 07:39.760
I'm willing to put myself out there. I'm secure enough for myself to be who I am

07:40.760 --> 07:42.760
I

07:43.280 --> 07:50.360
Love that I'm I am here and I'm anxious to see where the next few years take

07:51.760 --> 07:53.760
Yeah

07:53.880 --> 07:56.400
Good wealth and health and all that running around

07:57.040 --> 08:00.280
Now, let me ask you a question because I know you pretty much forward and all that

08:00.280 --> 08:03.440
Yeah, I love peace of the shit on your face. What?

08:04.320 --> 08:07.080
It's Vidalaga Vidalaga Vidalaga, right?

08:07.880 --> 08:13.040
Is that one of the reason I didn't want to get too serious with this? Come on. Yeah, I know I know okay

08:13.040 --> 08:16.280
So let's start dancing to say the patio. There you go. Big man. There you go

08:18.480 --> 08:26.320
My Vidalago happened I wasn't born with this talk a little loud. I wasn't born with this. Okay. I was 21

08:27.440 --> 08:31.720
When it started off as a small little scratch it looked like a scratch

08:32.600 --> 08:34.480
but

08:34.480 --> 08:41.400
Understand every human body is different. Yeah, everybody's Vidalago is different Michael Jackson had all over his hands

08:41.400 --> 08:45.840
He had all over my personal Vidalago story had to do a stress

08:45.840 --> 08:48.600
I was very stressful when I was 21 and

08:49.840 --> 08:56.040
The root cause for my stress I rooted it out and when I was 22 it stopped

08:56.400 --> 08:59.320
So my Vidalago has just been it's just this

09:00.320 --> 09:05.320
And once I cut out that stress I stopped stressing in my life really it stopped spreading

09:05.320 --> 09:08.440
So that's as far as it's gonna go. God bless as far as I know

09:08.720 --> 09:15.000
All right, so what Vidalago is is basically when your white blood cells attack your pigment cells

09:15.400 --> 09:17.400
That's Vidalaga

09:17.600 --> 09:22.960
There's no cream. There's no reason as to why as far as my knowledge goes

09:23.200 --> 09:28.120
No one knows why your white blood cells just start attacking your pigment cells

09:28.480 --> 09:33.040
The only thing doctors can say is it may be stress-related. It's not hereditary

09:33.800 --> 09:37.520
Nobody in my family had it. It's not something I could pass on to my kid

09:38.600 --> 09:44.720
Every human body is different. Everybody was trans responses stress different. Oh, yeah, some people gain weight

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Some people lose their mind

09:47.400 --> 09:51.720
Modest my stress caused me to develop it a lot. That's how it is

09:52.320 --> 09:56.240
Yeah, you're very honest and forthcoming dude, so I figure there ain't a problem

09:57.520 --> 10:04.520
You feel like you do better with women outside the country as far as Columbia, Thailand

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Columbia and all that

10:11.720 --> 10:15.520
My experience with women is pretty much the same everywhere

10:15.520 --> 10:17.520
Um

10:17.800 --> 10:21.840
Because my approach to women is always the same. I don't

10:23.280 --> 10:29.040
I'm currently not looking for a relationship at all. Hmm. So every

10:30.040 --> 10:32.040
basis of me

10:32.080 --> 10:34.960
interacting with a woman is on a

10:35.480 --> 10:42.480
Friendship. Hey, what's going on? Hey, you want to go out? No, okay? Bye. All right, whatever or hey, we got this in play

10:42.480 --> 10:43.400
it's

10:43.400 --> 10:44.520
it's

10:44.520 --> 10:48.360
I'm not looking for anything. So because I don't have that I

10:48.920 --> 10:54.840
Don't have to worry about that. Right. Everything is just how it is. Right. So I have the exact same success

10:55.520 --> 10:57.520
here and

10:58.280 --> 11:00.280
I spoke about the energy thing earlier

11:01.120 --> 11:03.760
It doesn't matter what country I went to I

11:04.200 --> 11:10.600
Have had a shared experience in every country which blows my mind

11:15.520 --> 11:24.600
I've made connections with women that are deep and we don't even speak the same language and of course

11:25.760 --> 11:27.260
the

11:27.260 --> 11:30.860
The trope is oh, they only doing it for your money. No

11:31.520 --> 11:37.720
No, this is this morning. Yeah, it's morning. When you're able to talk to someone every day

11:38.240 --> 11:42.840
And money is never the conversation. We're talking about what do you like to do?

11:42.840 --> 11:46.200
What's your family do like what you doing today? What's your job? What's your goals?

11:46.200 --> 11:50.640
Like it's a connection. That's deeper than just a transaction

11:51.280 --> 11:54.900
So and I've had that experience every country I've been to

11:57.240 --> 11:59.240
It's kind of dope

12:01.400 --> 12:06.560
So you really feel in the vibe like it's an energy thing with you it's like I think it's true

12:06.560 --> 12:11.200
I think when you run into people there's a connection like this guy's cool and this guy's a jerk

12:11.200 --> 12:17.200
Yeah, you know I'm in like so definitely an energy thing like you know I'm saying like you're meeting good people good

12:17.200 --> 12:18.800
Bob's the energy

12:18.800 --> 12:26.280
You know I'm saying now imagine a question when you out here. Do you ever see yourself like living living here and working here?

12:26.920 --> 12:28.920
Fucker. Well

12:31.600 --> 12:36.480
I'm not in a state where I'm not in a position where I can just

12:37.360 --> 12:42.680
Drop everything. I have a I have a child an older child teenager. Yeah

12:46.680 --> 12:48.960
She's my number one priority, of course

12:51.080 --> 12:57.880
After that a couple years, I have no idea, but that's why I'm traveling now, right so I can get an idea of

12:59.080 --> 13:01.320
The possibilities that might be right

13:02.040 --> 13:04.240
That might be presented to me later, right?

13:05.160 --> 13:10.400
Do you feel like as a black man, do you feel a difference traveling as opposed to Gunther back there?

13:11.960 --> 13:13.960
Well

13:14.320 --> 13:19.800
Being from America, it's hard to not notice the differences, but

13:20.760 --> 13:27.520
As a black man as a black man, you already know there's certain things you want to encounter certain advantages of shit

13:27.520 --> 13:29.840
I'm not just certain things you'll encounter, you know

13:31.200 --> 13:32.720
but I

13:32.740 --> 13:40.360
Try not to let negative things spoil or outweigh the positives because there's a lot of positive

13:42.040 --> 13:45.000
As humans we focus on the negative that's just what we do

13:45.480 --> 13:48.560
But I like to focus on a positive good interactions

13:49.200 --> 13:54.800
You know the friendly interactions I have I like to focus on that one. Yeah, how are you with the people?

13:55.440 --> 14:01.560
What do you think about we switch it up just a little bit little something on that? We think soy six. Hey like say six

14:02.960 --> 14:04.960
Sys compared to Pedro Casante

14:05.240 --> 14:07.080
What's Pedro Casante?

14:07.080 --> 14:10.080
Pedro Casante is with Rumba and all that shit. He said where's Pedro Casante?

14:10.800 --> 14:15.880
Two on five just pulled up. Mr. Workout sitting written there for five minutes and came back out

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
See what he had

14:22.000 --> 14:24.280
Soy six was cool at first. I didn't think

14:25.440 --> 14:30.560
I thought it'd be a little it was a little much, but nah, I dapped it. It's cool. I like it

14:30.560 --> 14:32.560
Yeah, okay

14:33.760 --> 14:37.000
If you can cuz you leaving basically tonight, yeah

14:37.120 --> 14:42.400
But I deal like if you could just blink your eyes like a genie and all that how many more days would you stay? Oh?

14:44.400 --> 14:50.560
I will say another week. Okay. Okay, cuz I will turn this trip because we're in Asia

14:50.560 --> 14:57.680
I also want to go to the Philippines. I will turn this trip into another trip and go to the Philippines for like four days

14:58.360 --> 15:04.540
Don't you think you could really call your job be like y'all twist my ankle at the shoreline? Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye

15:06.200 --> 15:12.400
I'm not coming in. Nah, I don't mess with my money. I don't mess with my money. I'm budget everything

15:13.000 --> 15:16.160
So it's right drama, right? Yeah CDL truck driver

15:18.160 --> 15:19.640
I

15:19.640 --> 15:22.880
I'm in I'm in the black. I like to stay in the black

15:23.520 --> 15:26.440
I'm for seeing occurrences before everyone so I

15:27.160 --> 15:29.160
Don't wait for I

15:30.200 --> 15:35.800
Don't wait for things to happen. Let's start grinding. I'd rather grind right force them happen so that I can be ready

15:35.800 --> 15:39.920
I I you know what? I totally dig that cause fly different color

15:39.920 --> 15:43.960
I know I dig a hundred percent where you're coming from man

15:44.200 --> 15:49.040
Like, you know, every you know saying like I feel like it's gonna sound corny. I'm like you listen to

15:49.840 --> 15:55.320
But like, you know, you're driving your job your responsibility obligation. I feel like me being out here

15:55.320 --> 16:00.720
I'm like the test dummy for the niggas that haven't came yet. You know, like I was here two more times before this time

16:01.080 --> 16:04.440
So I kind of feel like this is my job condo. I don't know

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
you're doing a great service because

16:07.760 --> 16:11.240
one of the reasons one of the reasons why I felt super comfortable

16:11.960 --> 16:17.400
Going this trip is because I already knew that we were gonna be with somebody who's been out here already. That's what's up

16:17.400 --> 16:24.080
So knowing how to move is very important when you go places, right? For instance, um

16:25.560 --> 16:27.560
Layover is in Qatar

16:27.600 --> 16:30.320
You can't move the same way in Qatar

16:30.600 --> 16:35.640
World that you do in America. I picked those sides to you will have a very rude awakening

16:36.440 --> 16:40.360
Thinking that you can move that way in Qatar. You know what though? You ain't got no visors

16:40.360 --> 16:45.160
I'm in the bad from sneaking my vape and shit. I'm like, you think it's for me under for like two years

16:45.160 --> 16:50.360
Yeah, see, I don't I don't indulge in nothing. I'll drink a beer or two. That's dope, but uh

16:51.040 --> 16:54.260
But that's for another reason. I'm afraid. I'm very afraid of drugs

16:54.660 --> 16:58.780
Very afraid of what drugs because I have a very addictive

16:59.420 --> 17:04.780
Personality like if I find something I like it's too hard to stop. So I'm too afraid just to try anything

17:05.220 --> 17:09.100
Too afraid. So do you ever could see you ever see yourself?

17:09.940 --> 17:13.060
With an entire woman like full-time part-time. I

17:14.180 --> 17:15.620
Should on buddy

17:15.620 --> 17:22.380
Um, actually remember that connection I was talking about earlier in Bangkok. I sort of had a nice connection with

17:23.260 --> 17:26.580
Taya her name is Taya Taya, okay, Taya

17:28.980 --> 17:30.980
Unfortunately, we weren't there long enough

17:31.140 --> 17:35.300
but I feel like the energy she was giving I

17:36.420 --> 17:41.700
Could have that could have turned into something. Okay, I had more time. So I won't say no

17:42.420 --> 17:47.460
But I'm sure Taya isn't the only one I could have felt that way. So I'm not gonna say no

17:47.460 --> 17:51.180
I'm not gonna say a hundred percent. I'll say it's possible. Now. Listen

17:51.620 --> 17:53.620
There's a strong strong

17:55.380 --> 18:00.380
Philadelphia community that traveling man, like the Philly get now nice. Okay, shorty

18:00.900 --> 18:08.260
Go crowd. Just sitting you at the spot. That's the best spot. Okay. Oh, yeah Philly runs a lot of brothers from Philadelphia, bro

18:09.300 --> 18:15.900
Good. Yeah, and it was crazy. Philadelphia's only 30 minutes big. That's crazy. Yeah, like that's crazy to me

18:15.900 --> 18:18.220
I encourage everyone to travel

18:19.140 --> 18:24.500
Everyone well, even if you can only travel one time per year, right? Just do it

18:25.420 --> 18:28.500
Even if you're for five a five-day trip, let's say

18:29.220 --> 18:30.700
because

18:30.700 --> 18:32.060
okay

18:32.060 --> 18:33.780
From Philadelphia

18:33.780 --> 18:35.780
You can leave from the Philadelphia airport

18:35.900 --> 18:41.700
We're connecting flights from Miami to the DR or you can catch the train and Amtrak

18:42.020 --> 18:44.740
Catch that up to New York. Do a straight flight to the DR

18:45.380 --> 18:52.900
From JFK, it's so simple. It's so cheap. It's so simple that one trip will inspire you

18:53.860 --> 18:54.820
to

18:54.820 --> 18:58.540
Take another one. Yeah, the next you know, you're doing two a year

18:58.540 --> 19:04.420
You know, you know, you're doing three next. You know, you're doing four a year and now you're like, whoa every three months

19:04.420 --> 19:06.420
I just realized I'm somewhere else

19:07.180 --> 19:13.540
And that's how you grow as a person, right? It's impossible to take these trips and not have human interactions

19:13.540 --> 19:16.740
That's not gonna impact. It's impossible. Right impossible

19:17.420 --> 19:19.420
So that's the beauty of it

19:20.060 --> 19:22.060
That's dope, man. I mean

19:22.580 --> 19:27.580
Like I said, I was scared to death before I traveled to the Dominican Republic. So, you know, I tell people just take a chance

19:28.620 --> 19:30.620
Let me tell you something

19:33.460 --> 19:37.980
Do not listen to people

19:38.740 --> 19:47.300
Experience things on your own. I've never been to Thailand. I have had hundreds of people tell me there's nothing but ladyboys everywhere

19:47.300 --> 19:50.060
Oh, be careful. They're gonna run into it

19:50.540 --> 19:56.660
They never stepped outside of Philly the same people saying this word people who never stepped outside of Philly. I get here

19:56.820 --> 20:01.700
It's beautiful. I think I've ran into like four ladyboys my whole trip here

20:02.260 --> 20:03.740
for

20:04.180 --> 20:09.860
Even when I did I was in a pharmacy and one of them was helping me with my skin care

20:10.380 --> 20:16.780
Like I'm very secure in my sexuality. So it's like I'm not I'm not like afraid of

20:17.180 --> 20:21.300
Afraid to talk to him or anything. I know that's not that's not what I do

20:21.660 --> 20:23.660
So it's like it's not gonna be afraid of

20:24.060 --> 20:29.220
Like I feel like if people want to live the life they want to live they live my life

20:29.660 --> 20:34.100
Live yours, it's not to be afraid of so overall getting back to the main point

20:34.940 --> 20:41.820
Everybody's gonna have something to say. Oh, you go to the DR is nothing but STDs and everything or it's violence in

20:42.380 --> 20:45.620
No, go experience it for your side once you do that

20:46.740 --> 20:50.460
You'll see do you see yourself coming back to Thailand anytime soon

20:54.660 --> 20:56.500
Probably next year

20:56.500 --> 21:02.060
Probably next year I have some other trips longer. It's gonna be longer next time. Well, it'll be it'll be a duo

21:02.220 --> 21:04.060
I'm gonna split it

21:04.060 --> 21:09.260
Because I really want to go to the Philippines and you I heard you I think to to set it that you want to go to Phuket

21:09.460 --> 21:16.140
Yeah, I want to go to Phuket because I like the island man. Yeah, I like the islands. I love the water

21:17.340 --> 21:19.100
I

21:19.100 --> 21:21.100
Love the prices of everything here

21:21.940 --> 21:24.340
Like yacht excursions for hundred and eight dollars

21:25.220 --> 21:27.220
You're not much of a yacht will run you in Miami

21:37.100 --> 21:40.220
A lot of times I didn't want to get too deep into it, but you're a religious man

21:41.220 --> 21:46.860
Higher belief in God and all that that's what keeps us healthy and safe and all of that like I

21:47.700 --> 21:52.300
Think it's important that you know, you know, you're religious and all that like you still

21:53.100 --> 21:56.740
Travel right like you still playing on traveling. Look it down act like you don't know

21:56.740 --> 22:00.020
I know you didn't want to get I didn't want to get too deep into it to put you on the spot

22:00.340 --> 22:07.260
But you know you're a religious man. Yes, I do believe in a creator flesh is weak. I do believe in the creator

22:10.420 --> 22:15.620
Yeah, I will contain a travel okay, we believe that that is uncomfortable just like talking about the Eagles

22:15.620 --> 22:17.620
It's very uncomfortable. No, I'm not really eaters

22:17.620 --> 22:23.340
No, you the same attitude you just took the same attitude you said I talk about the Eagles cheaters

22:24.100 --> 22:26.100
cheaters I

22:26.660 --> 22:32.820
Brought my Zikwan Barclay Jersey here. I got love. I got love right people that me up all over down here

22:33.260 --> 22:35.260
That's cuz everybody know

22:35.340 --> 22:39.700
World champs. What do you want to say to somebody that's scared to travel that hasn't traveled?

22:39.700 --> 22:42.500
I think you already covered it, but what would be a message to be like?

22:43.220 --> 22:48.820
Say like somebody that'd be like you met me at work. He's training and then you'd be like, uh-uh, I get killed

22:48.820 --> 22:54.580
Can I people say that about the or still I'll get killed if I go out there and they still say that I get killed if I go out there

22:54.820 --> 23:00.140
All right, so I would say reach out to some different people in the travel you

23:00.580 --> 23:07.220
Youtubers. Yes reach out because the one thing about the travel community is we encourage we want more

23:07.460 --> 23:12.340
We want more members of the travel community. Thanks, and I can't speak for

23:12.500 --> 23:17.700
Every single person, but I would say at least eight out of ten will direct you in a way

23:18.340 --> 23:22.820
That will benefit you like we're not out here to fool you to steal your money

23:23.340 --> 23:25.340
We want you to have a successful

23:26.780 --> 23:29.660
Excessful encounter when you do travel reach out

23:30.580 --> 23:35.540
Talk to different people ask them. Yeah, right down questions. Ask them exactly what you do

23:35.540 --> 23:41.460
Is it safe? How do you how do I take out money? Where can I use my card here? Like just ask

23:43.460 --> 23:45.220
Just ask

23:45.220 --> 23:51.620
Yeah, cuz once you actually do it, you'll see you're like, oh, I was afraid of a lot of things that were unnecessary

23:51.820 --> 23:56.180
What was the scariest part about taking this flight even though you was going with my man over there?

23:56.900 --> 23:58.900
She's well, I'm

23:59.540 --> 24:02.340
320 pounds so the thing I was most afraid of was sitting there see

24:02.980 --> 24:04.980
like so I

24:05.900 --> 24:10.380
Was able to get in the seat and I was I was cool, but that was scary. I didn't know that

24:10.940 --> 24:14.340
That's a proper thing to pay, but you got to realize that people travel too

24:15.220 --> 24:18.140
We know they turn us into cargo planes and shit

24:18.140 --> 24:23.860
There's no seats just let us roll around at the planes moving and shit, but also that's a form of inspiration also

24:25.300 --> 24:29.380
For myself personally don't go too deep. I'm not you only got a certain amount of time

24:30.500 --> 24:32.500
Because we look around his dog they close

24:34.980 --> 24:36.980
All the stuff at the base like

24:36.980 --> 24:38.980
No

24:39.860 --> 24:47.220
Close it out close it out bring this home land the plane so not traveling you want it it forces you

24:47.940 --> 24:49.940
to want to do more

24:49.940 --> 24:50.900
fact and

24:50.900 --> 24:58.260
Better job proceed. No, no job. I'm talking about health wise. Okay, and there are some things that you're

24:59.100 --> 25:04.660
Your weight may prohibit you from doing paracels. I wanted to paracels. They was like, hey, you're too heavy

25:07.340 --> 25:14.340
Okay, Brandon. Well, Brandon, if you want a paracel get that weight down you want to skydive get that weight down facts

25:14.340 --> 25:18.900
So now I have in my mind. All right. They might have did you explain the patient? Yeah

25:20.500 --> 25:25.940
No, it's not to be a it's not to be angry about or angry at somebody else. It's self-motivation

25:26.580 --> 25:33.020
That's all okay because the next time I take a pic with me paracel and I'm gonna reference back this video

25:33.340 --> 25:37.020
From when I was too happy to do it. Well, you don't watch my channel anyway, brother

25:37.020 --> 25:40.060
Then when I post you I'll be talking about shit. You don't know nothing about

25:42.740 --> 25:47.620
You say you watch YouTube as a shit, you don't know nothing what I'm saying. I bet you don't even subscribe

25:47.620 --> 26:02.220
